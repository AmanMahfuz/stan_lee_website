            <h1>Cameo in filim's</h1>
            <p>Lee had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, including those within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[205] A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in the creation of certain characters.[206] He additionally voiced a cameo appearance as himself in the 2018 DC Comics movie Teen Titans Go! To the Movies.[207] Out of respect for Lee, Marvel Studios enacted a new policy following his death that forbids cameos by Lee in new films by using archive footage of him,[208] with Avengers: Endgame (2019) marking his final appearance; the film was released several months after his death.</p>
